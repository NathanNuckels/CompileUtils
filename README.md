# CompilerUtils

This is a simple GUI I made to make it easier to 
compile java projects.

Projects will have three folders. 
`src/`, `build/`, and `release/`

`src/` contains java files and and data they need.
Clicking the build button will compile the code to the
`build/` folder. 

The `release/` folder will have a compiled jar file.

The commit button will run a git commit with no argunents.
(this will open whatever text editor you use for `core.editor`)

Note to devs:
Do not push over mobile data!
